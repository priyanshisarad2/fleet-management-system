  authentication_mode = how EKS decides who can access the cluster.
  Valid values are `CONFIG_MAP`, `API` or `API_AND_CONFIG_MAP`

  - CONFIG_MAP: old way. You edit the in-cluster `aws-auth` ConfigMap to add IAM users/roles and their Kubernetes groups.

  - API: new way (recommended) You create EKS "Access Entries" in AWS for an IAM user/role and attach admin/view policies. You do NOT edit `aws-auth`. Instead you tell AWS:
    1) "This IAM user/role can access this cluster" (Access Entry)
    2) "This is their permission level" (attach an EKS access policy like Admin/View)

  - API_AND_CONFIG_MAP: hybrid. Both Access Entries + `aws-auth` ConfigMap are used (good for migration) - IF let say you are migrating from on-prem to AWS EKS.

    Now, the aws profile I created woith credentials - is for my "devops" IAM user - who is also the creator of cluster
    So, I can give admin access to this user to access the cluster via EKS Access Entry

    Now, even though this "devops" has IAM policy attached to it - which gives it admin access for AWS accounts - it does not mean that it will automatically have admin access to EKS cluster.
    We need to give it admin access to EKS cluster via EKS Access Entry.

    So setting this flag to true will give admin access to the "devops" user for this EKS cluster and will create an EKS Access Entry for it.

   Important: By setting the "enable_cluster_creator_admin_permissions" to "true" - I gave "devops" user admin access to this EKS cluster via EKS Access Entry.

   But the root user of my AWS account - does not have admin access to this EKS cluster - even though it has admin access to AWS account.

   So, I need to give root user admin access to this EKS cluster via EKS Access Entry. I need to create an EKS Access Entry for it.
