  /*
  A Network ACL (Access Control List) is a stateless security feature in AWS 
  that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level within a VPC. 
  It functions as a firewall, allowing or denying traffic based on rules you define, 
  such as IP address, port, and protocol. 
  Network ACLs are applied to individual subnets, and each subnet can have its own set of rules. 
  It helps manage traffic between resources in different subnets and control internet access to specific 
  parts of your network, ensuring the security and proper isolation of your resources.

  By default, Network ACLs allow all inbound and outbound traffic. You can create custom 
  rules to both allow and deny specific traffic based on IP, port, and protocol.
